## Decisions Log

- **Lore depth:** Minimal. One-liner per character, not full backstories.
- **Auction mechanic:** Bid with Mad Scientists 10k collection NFTs. Highest bidder wins.
- **Page strategy:** `/cosmic` is currently unlisted. Goes live on Day 5 reveal.
- **Silhouettes:** Only 3 of 5 scientists teased — avoids repetition.
- **Auction visual:** GIF instead of static explainer graphic — matches team's content style.
- **Hero:** Will be replaced with lineup poster asset when ready. Logo may be part of the poster.

- [ ] Swap hero with lineup poster asset (when ready)
