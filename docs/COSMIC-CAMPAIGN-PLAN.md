# COSMIC Campaign Plan

> Full-funnel 10-day Twitter/X campaign for the Mad Scientists COSMIC 1/1 collection.
> Goal: Awareness → Community growth → Auction bids.

---

## 1. Campaign Overview

**Campaign name:** COSMIC Retrieval
**Summary:** A 10-day Twitter/X campaign that teases, reveals, and auctions 5 hand-crafted 1/1 Mad Scientists — driving awareness across the Osmosis NFT ecosystem, pulling new holders into the community, and converting existing holders into bidders.
**Primary objective:** Maximize total bids placed across all 5 COSMIC auctions.
**Secondary objectives:**
- Grow @MadScientists Twitter followers by 15–25% during the campaign window
- Drive 500+ unique visitors to `/cosmic` in the first 48 hours after reveal (Day 5)
- Increase Discord active members by 10–20% via campaign-driven interest

---

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary: Existing Mad Scientists 10k holders
- **Who:** Current holders of Mad Scientists 10k collection NFTs on Osmosis/Stargaze
- **Pain points:** Want utility and exclusivity from their holdings; looking for reasons their NFTs have value beyond floor price
- **Motivation:** Chance to convert a stack of 10k NFTs into a rare 1/1 — massive perceived upgrade
- **Where they are:** Twitter/X (NFT CT), Mad Scientists Discord, Osmosis ecosystem chats
- **Buying stage:** Decision — they already hold the bid asset

### Secondary: Osmosis / Cosmos NFT community
- **Who:** Active NFT collectors and traders in the Cosmos ecosystem who don't yet hold Mad Scientists
- **Pain points:** Looking for quality projects with strong art and active teams
- **Motivation:** Discovery of a polished 1/1 drop with a unique auction mechanic could drive them to acquire 10k NFTs to participate, or at minimum follow the project
- **Where they are:** Twitter/X, Stargaze community, Osmosis governance forums
- **Buying stage:** Awareness → Consideration

## 3. Key Messages

### Core message
> "5 escaped the lab. Bid your Mad Scientists to bring them back."

### Supporting messages

| # | Message | Audience | Proof point |
|---|---------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **"Each one is a standalone 1/1 — no duplicates exist."** | Everyone | Hand-crafted pixel art, unique lore per character |
| 2 | **"Your 10k Scientists are your tickets in."** | Existing holders | Auction mechanic: bid by stacking 10k NFTs, losers refunded |
| 3 | **"No minimum bid. Stack what you've got."** | Smaller holders | On-chain smart contract, transparent, low barrier to entry |
| 4 | **"5 parallel auctions. Pick your lane."** | Competitive bidders | Each scientist has its own auction — strategic choice matters |

### Tone
Mysterious during tease phase (Days 1–4), confident and direct during reveal (Days 5–7), urgent and competitive during auction (Days 8–10). Always in-character with the "mad science lab" brand voice — punchy, dark humor, pixel-art aesthetic.

---

## 4. Channel Strategy

### Twitter/X (sole channel)

**Why:** This is where Cosmos NFT culture lives. The audience is already here. A focused single-channel approach avoids dilution and lets every post build on the previous one — critical for a 10-day narrative arc.

**Content formats:**
- Static image tweets (silhouettes, identity cards, lineup poster)
- GIF tweet (auction mechanic explainer)
- Thread (reveal day deep-dive)
- Quote tweets / engagement farming (polls, "which scientist are you" etc.)
- Pinned tweet rotation (mystery → reveal → auction link)

**Effort level:** High — 1–2 posts per day for 10 days, plus real-time engagement.

**Tactics:**
- **Header swap** on Day 1 — cosmic purple header signals something's changed before any announcement
- **Pinned tweet rotation** — update pinned tweet at each phase transition (tease → reveal → auction)
- **Reply-guy energy** — actively reply to quote tweets, react to speculation, stay in the timeline
- **Countdown framing** — every post after Day 5 should reference how many days/hours until auction closes

### Discord (supporting, not primary)
Although Twitter/X is the primary channel, coordinate key moments in Discord:
- Day 1: Tease in announcements channel
- Day 5: Reveal drop with link to `/cosmic`
- Day 9: Auction-open announcement with instructions
- Throughout: Answer questions, share bidding updates

## 5. Content Calendar

| Day | Phase | Tweet Content | Visual Asset | Pin? | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------------|--------------|------|-------|
| 1 | Tease | "Something's coming." Mystery tweet. Swap Twitter header to cosmic purple. | Cosmic Twitter header (new) | Yes | Keep it vague. No details. Let people speculate. |
| 2 | Tease | Silhouette drop #1 — shadowed scientist with cryptic one-liner | Silhouette image #1 | No | Respond to replies but don't confirm anything |
| 3 | Tease | Silhouette drop #2 — different scientist | Silhouette image #2 | No | Engagement tweet: "What do you think is happening?" |
| 4 | Tease | Silhouette drop #3 — third scientist. "Tomorrow." | Silhouette image #3 | No | Build tension. Short copy. Let the art do the work. |

| 7 | Reveal | Identity cards batch 2 (The Antiquarian, The Dreamer) + "Which scientist are you?" engagement poll | 2 identity cards | No | Poll drives engagement. Closes before auction opens. |
| 8 | Auction | Auction mechanic reveal — "Bid Scientists. Win Scientists." Explain the 4 steps. | Auction GIF (`cosmic-auction.gif`) | Yes | Clear, simple explanation. Link to `/cosmic#auction`. Update auction button href. |
| 9 | Auction | Auction opens — pinned tweet with instructions and link. "5 lanes. 5 scientists. Go." | Lineup poster (repurposed) or custom "AUCTION LIVE" graphic | Yes | **Update per-scientist auction status text.** Real-time bid updates throughout the day if possible. |
| 10 | Auction | Final call — "Hours left." Countdown energy. Announce winners after close. | Winner reveal graphics (if prepared) | Yes | Urgency. Short tweets. Frequent updates. Post-auction: celebrate winners, thank community. |

### Dependencies

- Auction GIF must be ready before Day 8 (currently placeholder on site)
- Auction smart contract must be deployed and tested before Day 9
- NavBar/Footer COSMIC links uncommenting happens on Day 5
- Auction button href + per-scientist status text updated on Day 9

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric | Type | Target | How to track | Cadence |
|--------|------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Total bids placed across all 5 auctions | Primary KPI | 25+ unique bids | On-chain auction contract | Daily (Days 8–10) |
| Unique visitors to `/cosmic` | Secondary | 500+ in first 48h | Vercel Analytics | Daily |
| Twitter impressions (campaign total) | Secondary | 100k+ across 10 days | Twitter Analytics | Daily |
| New Twitter followers during campaign | Secondary | +15–25% | Twitter Analytics | End of campaign |
| Discord new members during campaign | Secondary | +10–20% | Discord server insights | End of campaign |
| Engagement rate on reveal tweet (Day 5) | Secondary | 5%+ | Twitter Analytics | Day 5–6 |
| Average bid size (Mad Scientists stacked) | Secondary | 8+ NFTs per bid | On-chain data | End of auction |

**Reporting:** Quick daily check on impressions + engagement. Full debrief after Day 10 with all metrics.

## 8. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Low bid participation** — holders don't bid enough NFTs or don't bid at all | Medium | High | Start explaining the mechanic early (Day 8). Make it dead simple. Emphasize "losers get refunded" to lower perceived risk. Consider last-minute reminder tweets on Day 10. |
| **Asset delays** — silhouettes, identity cards, or auction GIF not ready on schedule | Medium | Medium | Build 1-day buffer into asset creation. Days 2–4 silhouettes are simpler to produce. Auction GIF is the highest-risk asset — have a static fallback graphic ready. |
| **Smart contract issues** — auction contract has bugs or isn't ready by Day 9 | Low | Critical | Test contract on testnet before Day 8 mechanic reveal. Don't announce auction dates until contract is confirmed ready. Have a "delay" tweet template prepared. |

---

## 9. Site Changes Synchronized with Campaign

These site updates from `COSMIC-LAUNCH.md` must happen on specific campaign days:

| Day | Site change |
|-----|------------|
| 5 | Uncomment NavBar + Footer COSMIC links → `/cosmic` goes live |
| 8 | Drop in `cosmic-auction.gif` at `/public/images/cosmic-auction.gif` |
| 9 | Update auction button `href` + text. Update per-scientist auction status text (replace "Auction opens soon"). |

---
